## Why I started this site

I started this site to talk about my experiences as a computer science student and give new students a bit of insight into what life is like as a computer science student.

I will also post explanations about topics that new computer science students seem to struggle with at a fundamental level in order to assist students and not discourage them by being super technical.

My blog section will be updated on a weekly basis which will vary from computer science topics to my experiences as a day to day life in college.

There's a bit of something for everyone here so I hope you find something you enjoy!
