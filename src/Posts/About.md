## How My Journey Began
My journey started in highschool where I was enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles and started coding in Python. My teacher was a better than average teacher since he went to college for computer science with a cyber security track related and worked in the field for a bit of time before he decided that teaching was his passion. In the early days of this class we used a lot of code academy, while I think Code Academy is decent, it wasn't my style of learning and I didn't benefit a lot from it. When the final project came around I really got into software development and had a great learning experience that was not only academic, but also spiritual in a way because I learned that creating software is something I am truly passionate about!

The game I created in Python was a spanish triva game where a spanish word appeared on the screen and it was the user's job to choose the correct answer from the multiple choices on the screen. Should they choose wrong, the game ended and displayed how many they got correct, otherwise the user kept going until they got to the end. In the end, I learned a lot because not only did I learn Python, but I also learned about a nifty library for GUI's known as Tkinter. 

My AP Computer Science Principles class led me to becoming who I am with the passion I have today. If only I still had the source code to that life changing program!
