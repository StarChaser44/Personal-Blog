## How My Journey Began
My journey started in highschool where I was enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles and started coding in Python. My teacher was a better than average teacher since he went to college in a CS related field and worked in the field for a bit of time before he decided that teaching was his passion. In the early days of this class we used a lot of code academy, while I think Code Academy is decent, it wasn't really my style of learning and didn't benefit a lot from it. It wasn't until we got to the final project that I really started to get into Python and coding itself.

Being new to "development in Python" I created a game in Python for my final project. The game was a spanish triva game where a spanish word appeared on the screen and it was the user's job to choose the correct mulitple choice answer. Should they choose wrong, the game ended otherwise the game ended when they got enough answers correct. In the end, I learned a lot about development and was one of the main projects that led me to being who I am today.
